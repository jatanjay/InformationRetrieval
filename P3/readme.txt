What percent is that : 10056 / 27217  == 0.3694749605 * 100 == 36.947%
Is that what you would expect? Why or why not : Yes, I do. given the nature of the dataset, where every article can have lot of new subject matter, high unique words are bound to happen
If this was newspaper dataset, i would be surprised.
